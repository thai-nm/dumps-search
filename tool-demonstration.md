## Objective

A simple Python CLI tool to search for questions/answers of a specific topic on Exam Topics and save them as PDF files.
These PDF files later on will be merged into a single PDF file.

## How it works

- The tool should accept:
  - The keyword to search for the topic on Exam Topics
  - The start number of question
  - The end number of question
- The tool will use the provided search keywords and the start/end question number to send requests to Duckduckgo to search for ExamTopics URLs which contain the question and answer
- The tool will use the collected URLs to download the page as PDFs
- The tool will merge the PDF files into one

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Project Setup and Foundation
**Goal**: Establish the basic project structure and development environment

**Tasks**:
- Create Python package structure with proper directory layout
- Set up virtual environment and dependency management
- Configure development tools (linting, formatting, testing)
- Initialize Git repository and basic documentation
- Create basic CLI entry point with argument parsing

**Deliverables**:
- Working project skeleton
- Basic CLI that accepts keyword, start, and end parameters
- Development environment ready for coding

### Phase 2: Search Functionality
**Goal**: Implement the core search mechanism to find ExamTopics URLs

**Tasks**:
- Research and implement open-source DuckDuckGo search libraries (e.g., `duckduckgo-search`, `requests-html`)
- Develop query construction logic for ExamTopics site filtering
- Create URL extraction and validation mechanisms from search results
- Implement rate limiting and error handling for search requests
- Add logging and debugging capabilities
- Handle search result parsing and pagination if needed

**Deliverables**:
- Functional search module that returns ExamTopics URLs using open-source libraries
- Command-line tool that can search and display found URLs
- Basic error handling for network issues and search failures

### Phase 3: PDF Generation from URLs
**Goal**: Convert ExamTopics pages to PDF format using weasyprint

**Tasks**:
- Implement weasyprint for direct HTML to PDF conversion
- Fetch HTML content from URLs collected in Phase 1 and 2
- Remove popup banner if any

**Deliverables**:
- Working PDF generation from ExamTopics URLs using weasyprint
- Clean, formatted PDFs

### Phase 4: PDF Processing and Merging
**Goal**: Combine individual PDFs into a single consolidated file

**Tasks**:
- Implement PDF merging functionality

**Deliverables**:
- Single merged PDF output with all questions

### Phase 5: Enhanced CLI and User Experience
**Goal**: Polish the user interface and add advanced features

**Tasks**:
- Enhance CLI with better argument validation and help text
- Add progress bars and status indicators
- Implement concurrent downloading for better performance
- Add configuration file support for user preferences
- Create comprehensive error messages and user guidance

**Deliverables**:
- Professional CLI tool with excellent user experience
- Concurrent processing capabilities
- Configurable options for different use cases

### Phase 6: Testing and Quality Assurance
**Goal**: Ensure reliability and maintainability of the tool

**Tasks**:
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all modules
- Implement integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Add mock testing for external dependencies
- Set up continuous integration pipeline
- Perform cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)

**Deliverables**:
- High test coverage (>80%)
- Automated testing pipeline
- Verified cross-platform compatibility

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1: ✅ Basic CLI responds to help commands
### Phase 2: ✅ Successfully finds and lists ExamTopics URLs
### Phase 3: ✅ Generates clean PDF from single ExamTopics page
### Phase 4: ✅ Merges multiple PDFs into single file
### Phase 5: ✅ Handles concurrent downloads efficiently
### Phase 6: ✅ Passes all tests with >80% coverage

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **ExamTopics changes**: Implement flexible scraping with easy configuration updates
- **Rate limiting**: Add configurable delays and retry mechanisms
- **PDF generation failures**: Implement fallback PDF engines
- **Cross-platform issues**: Test on multiple operating systems early

### Legal/Ethical Risks
- **Terms of Service**: Respect robots.txt and implement reasonable rate limiting
- **Copyright concerns**: Focus on educational use and avoid content redistribution
- **Anti-bot measures**: Use ethical scraping practices and user-agent rotation

### Operational Risks
- **Dependency conflicts**: Pin versions and test compatibility regularly
- **User support**: Create clear documentation and issue templates
