# ExamTopics PDF Scraper - Implementation Phases

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed implementation phases for the ExamTopics PDF Scraper project, providing a structured approach to development with clear milestones, deliverables, and dependencies.

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup

### 1.1 Project Infrastructure

#### Deliverables:
- [ ] Project directory structure creation
- [ ] Virtual environment setup
- [ ] Git repository initialization
- [ ] Basic `requirements.txt` with core dependencies
- [ ] Initial `setup.py` configuration
- [ ] `.gitignore` file with Python-specific exclusions

#### Tasks:
1. Create project directory structure as defined in implementation plan
2. Initialize Python virtual environment
3. Install and configure development tools (pytest, black, flake8)
4. Set up version control with initial commit
5. Create basic project documentation structure

### 1.2 Configuration System

#### Deliverables:
- [ ] `config.py` module implementation
- [ ] `settings.json` template with sample exam configurations
- [ ] Configuration validation logic

#### Tasks:
1. Implement `ConfigManager` class with JSON loading capabilities
2. Create configuration validation methods
3. Design flexible exam configuration schema
4. Create sample configuration for testing

## Phase 2: Core Functionality

### 2.1 Search Engine Implementation

#### Deliverables:
- [ ] `search.py` module with DuckDuckGo integration
- [ ] URL validation and filtering logic
- [ ] Search result processing functions
- [ ] Error handling for network operations

#### Tasks:
1. Implement DuckDuckGo search wrapper
2. Create URL validation logic for ExamTopics filtering
3. Develop search result ranking and selection
4. Add retry mechanisms for network failures

### 2.2 PDF Generation Engine

#### Deliverables:
- [ ] `pdf_generator.py` module with weasyprint integration

#### Tasks:
1. Use weasyprint to get the page HTML from URL and then save as PDF
2. Implement error handling for generation failures

## Phase 3: Integration and Processing

### 3.1 PDF Merger Implementation

#### Deliverables:
- [x] `pdf_merger.py` module with PyPDF2/pypdf integration
- [x] Temporary file management system

#### Tasks:
1. Implement PDF merging functionality
2. Create temporary file cleanup mechanisms

### 3.2 Logging System

#### Deliverables:
- [ ] Use logging configuration from settings.json file
- [ ] Simplify log output: only show essential output INFO logs, keep other logs as DEBUG

#### Tasks:
1. Implement centralized logging setting
2. Simplify output log

## Phase 4: Documentation and Deployment (Optional)

### 4.1 Documentation and User Experience

#### Deliverables:
- [ ] Complete README.md with installation and usage instructions

#### Tasks:
1. Write comprehensive README with clear instructions
3. Create user guide with practical examples

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to developing the ExamTopics PDF Scraper with clear phases, deliverables, and success criteria for each stage of development.
